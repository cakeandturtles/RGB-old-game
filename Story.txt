Child playing in a fun peaceful field. Sound of a meteor crashing nearby and a mini earthquake accompanying. The boy runs to see what happened, and in the middle of a partially flaming crater is a glowing red stone. He runs up and grabs it, and the world goes bazonkers for a second and his next conscious sight is an entirely red firey field where the peaceful one stood a second ago. He sees a glowing pheonix or something else marvelous and fantastical perching a little bit ahead. He goes up to it but it is startled and flies away. Excited by the mystery of this thing and the adventure it promises, he runs off to chase it. Finds the other two stones quickly somehow, and then game starts and blah blah blah. Game mixes feeling of wonder&adventure&curiosity with fear&terror&survival&helplessness, both as motivations for progressing and not dying in the game as you explore the world further to simultaneously seek out the elusive wonder of childhood and the mystery of the world while trying to not be killed horribly and terribly by the harshness of it.

curiosity is the initial motivator
but when you start to get over your head
if you know you turn back you'll have no chance of survival
this thing that once represented a mere curiosity
now spells out a glimmer of hope for survival and rest

like you don't know what the hell is going on at first
but as soon as that stone hits the earth and you find it
something funky starts happening with the world
and for some reason it's getting more and more dangerous
so your only chance of survival is to grab that shit and find out how it can save you?




WORLD IS GRAY before the incident: i was thinking it would be good to show how boring and simple and nonthreatening the world is before this stone hits
